# Part A:

# Q1
The magnitude of a vector $\vec{v}$ is denoted by $||\vec{v}||$ and is calculated using the following formula:
$$||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2 + \cdots + v_n^2}$$

# Q2


To calculate the unit vector in the same direction as a given vector $\vec{v}$, we divide the vector $\vec{v}$ by its magnitude $||\vec{v}||$. This gives us a vector with the same direction as $\vec{v}$ , but with a magnitude of 1. This is also called a "normalized" vector.

Therefore, the unit vector $\hat{v}$ in the same direction as $\vec{v}$ is given by:

```math
\hat{v} = \frac{\vec{v}}{||\vec{v}||} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2 + \cdots + v_n^2}} \begin{bmatrix}     v_1 \\     v_2 \\     v_3 \\     \vdots \\     v_n \end{bmatrix}

```

# Q3

To scale a vector $\vec{v}$ by a constant $c$, we simply multiply each component of the vector $\vec{v}$ by the constant $c$. This can be expressed mathematically as:

```math
c\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}     cv_1 \\     cv_2 \\     cv_3 \\     \vdots \\     cv_n \end{bmatrix}
```
In other words, every component of the vector $\vec{v}$ is multiplied by the constant $c$, resulting in a new vector that has the same direction as $\vec{v}$, but with a different magnitude. If $c > 1$, then the resulting vector will have a larger magnitude than the original vector $\vec{v}$, and if $0 < c < 1$, then the resulting vector will have a smaller magnitude than $\vec{v}$. If $c < 0$, then the resulting vector will have the same direction as $\vec{v}$, but will be pointing in the opposite direction.

# Q4

To calculate a new position that is c units away from the position represented by the vector $\vec{v}$ in the direction of the unit vector $\vec{h}$, we can use the following formula:

```math
\vec{p} = \vec{v} + c\vec{h}

```
Here, $\vec{p}$ represents the new position vector. This formula can be derived as follows:

Since $\vec{h}$ is a unit vector, it represents a direction. To move c units in this direction, we simply multiply the vector $\vec{h}$ by the constant $c$ to get a vector that points in the same direction as $\vec{h}$, but with a magnitude of $c$. We then add this vector to the position vector $\vec{v}$ to get the new position vector $\vec{p}$.

In summary, the formula for the new position vector $\vec{p}$ is obtained by scaling the unit vector $\vec{h}$ by the constant $c$, and adding the resulting vector to the position vector $\vec{v}$.

# Turning a vector

In $\mathbb{R}^2$, a vector $\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1\v_2 \end{bmatrix}$ can be represented as an arrow pointing from the origin to the point $(v_1, v_2)$ in the plane. To rotate this vector by an angle $\theta$ clockwise, we want to find the coordinates of the point $(v_1, v_2)$ after rotating it by an angle of $\theta$ clockwise around the origin.

To do this, we can use the rotation matrix formula:
```math
\begin{bmatrix} \cos{\theta} & \sin{\theta} \\ -\sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \cos{\theta} + v_2 \sin{\theta} \\ -v_1 \sin{\theta} + v_2 \cos{\theta} \end{bmatrix}
```
