template<typename T, typename retType>
retType Sum(const T* arr, int  size)
{
    retType result = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < size; ++i) {
        result += arr[i];    
    }
    return result;
}

just observe this code and
answer these questions 

1) If we call the function using Sum<Student, double>(...), what global / friend / member functions/operators (for class Student) must exist so the code compiles and executes correctly? Provide their prototype (do not implement any of them).
2) What if the call is Sum<Student, Student> (...) ? Provide their prototype (do not implement any of them).
3)Explain why each one is needed.
